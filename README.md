# Sales Data Processing: ETL & ELT Approaches with MySQL and Hadoop

# Description:
Python scripts that process sales data from multiple CSV files using ETL and ELT approaches, with storage in a MySQL database and Hadoop MapReduce for further analysis.

# Abstract:
These scripts showcase two different approaches to handling sales data from multiple CSV files. The first script (ETL) extracts, transforms, and loads the data into a MySQL database, providing a robust solution for data storage and retrieval. The second script (ELT) concatenates the CSV files, transforms the data using pandas, and leverages Hadoop MapReduce for distributed processing and analysis. Both scripts include data cleaning, type conversions, and error handling to ensure accurate processing of the sales data.
