# Sales Data Processing: ETL & ELT Approaches with MySQL and Hadoop

# Description:
Python scripts for updating ID values for data consistency, processing data from CSV files using ETL and ELT methodologies, robust data handling and storage in a MySQL database and leveraging Hadoop Streaming for advanced data processing.

# Abstract:
The Python scripts provided demonstrate a comprehensive approach to processing sales data from multiple CSV files, utilizing both ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) methodologies, as well as an additional script for updating ID values. The ETL script reads sales data from CSV files, cleans and transforms the data, and then inserts it into a MySQL database, ensuring data integrity through error handling and logging. The ELT script concatenates the CSV files into a single DataFrame using pandas, applies a series of data transformations, and then employs a Hadoop Streaming for further data processing and analysis.

Additionally, the given script for updating ID values reads an input CSV file, calculates new ID values for the specified range, and writes the updated rows to an output CSV file. This script is useful for ensuring data consistency and uniqueness when integrating data from multiple sources or merging datasets.

All scripts emphasize efficient data processing techniques, meticulous error handling, and precise data type conversions, resulting in reliable and accurate outcomes suitable for various data-driven applications.
